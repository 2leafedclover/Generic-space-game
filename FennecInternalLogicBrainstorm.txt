Variables:
	Resources:
		Heat
		O2
		Hull Health (per area of ship)
		Fuel
		Coolant
		Functional O2 Generators
	Player Controlled Variables:
		NumTabs, the number of tabs/programs open on your terminal
		Throttle
		AirCon (like the fan from FNAF)
	Misc:
		Balancing constant C (differs per use)
Interactions:
	Internal:
		Per Second, O2 = O2 - C(Hull Damage) - C + Functional O2 Generators
		Per Second, Heat = Heat + C(NumTabs) + C(Throttle) - C(AirCon)
		Per Second, Coolant = Coolant - C(AirCon)
